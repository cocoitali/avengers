Challenge
Repeat the above process that we just did but create a react application from scratch called react-avengers.

This app is to take an array of Avengers stored on a state object inside of App.js and display each avenger in a list element on the screen.
Change the Welcome To React heading to Avengers: by <your-name>.
Once you’re finished, go ahead and create a git repository on your own github account and push this app to that repository.
Submit your Github Repo link to your Project Manager so they can see that you have demonstrated the ability to use a Create React App to build out something on your own.
